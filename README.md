# Task-List
Allows the user to keep track of their tasks that they plan on doing by allowing them to add tasks to a list that can be viewed, and deleting task that are done whilst looking at the new list with the remaining task. It utilizes python GUI and sql to create an GUI for the script that has a table to store the tasks and update them.
